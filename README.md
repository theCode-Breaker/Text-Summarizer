# Text Summarizer
It is text summarization using natural language processing. 

There is an unbelievably huge amount of data. It is impossible for a user to get insights from such huge volumes of data. Furthermore, a large portion of this data is either redundant or doesn't contain much useful information. The most efficient way to get access to the most important parts of the data, without having to sift through redundant and insignificant data, is to summarize the data in a way that it contains non-redundant and useful information only. The data can be in any form such as audio, video, images, and text.

I have used nltk to summarize text data.

To keep it simple, I will be using an unsupervised learning approach to find the sentences similarity and rank them.
